# SocialBotNet

This is a minimal social network with bot friendly API for educational purposes. The code is highly influenced by [eh3rrera/minitwit](https://github.com/eh3rrera/minitwit) using the Spark Framework.
This social network is intended for students to create a social bot for.

A running server can be visited on [https://www.socialbotnet.de](https://www.socialbotnet.de), check it out! You can also run your own server by building the project using Maven (see [build instructions](#build-instructions) below) or running the jar file from the [releases](https://github.com/Knorrke/socialbotnet/releases). It will start a jetty server on [localhost:30003](http://localhost:30003).

## Material
You find some [materials](https://www.socialbotnet.de/material) on the website to help you get started with programming your Bot in Java.

## API

The Network provides an easy-to-use API for fetching users, posts and posting to walls of users.

### Fetching data
The following GET requests are supported:

- GET request to `/api/users`: Receive all users registered on the SocialBotNet  
**Example output**  
```
[
  {
  	"id":1,
  	"username":"root",
  	"hobbies":"doing stuff",
  	"about":"I am root"
  },
  {
    "id":2,
    "username":"user002",
    "hobbies":"",
    "about":""
  }
]
```

- GET request to `/api/posts`: Receive all posts created on the SocialBotNet. They can be sorted by `likes` or `time` (default) using the `sortby` handle. Also the number of results can be limited by `limit` (default 50).
**params:**  
optional: `sortby`, optional: `limit`  
**Example output** 
Request to `/api/posts?sortby=likes&limit=1`
```
 {
    "id": 3,
    "message": "This is a post written by user user001 to user004",
    "user": { "id": 1, "username": "user001", "hobbies": "", "about": "" },
    "wall": { "id": 4, "username": "user004", "hobbies": "", "about": "" },
    "publishingDate": "2014-07-14 09:46:28",
    "likedBy": [
      { "id": 1, "username": "user001", "hobbies": "", "about": "" },
      { "id": 5, "username": "user005", "hobbies": "", "about": "" },
      { "id": 6, "username": "user006", "hobbies": "", "about": "" },
      { "id": 7, "username": "user007", "hobbies": "", "about": "" }
    ]
  }
]
```

- GET request to `/api/pinnwand/:username`: Receive all posts created on the SocialBotNet posted to `:username`s wall. They can be sorted by `likes` or `time` (default) using the `sortby` handle. Also the number of results can be limited by `limit` (default 50)  
**Example output**  
The output is exactly as from `/api/posts/`, but filtered after username of wall.

## Build instructions

Clone the project into a local repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Knorrke/socialbotnet.git
cd socialbotnet
```

If you are using an IDE supporting Maven (e.g. Eclipse), you should be able to just run the `app.Main` class. Otherwise build the project using Maven 
```
mvn clean package
```
and run it
```
java -jar target\social-bot-net-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Afterwards open [localhost:30003](http://localhost:30003) for the SocialBotNet.
